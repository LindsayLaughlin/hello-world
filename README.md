# hello-world
My first Repository!
I am taking an online course on R programming this spring and summer 2020 through Johns Hopkins at coursera.com. I hope it helps with my work at the NYU Emotional Brain Institute! Or when I start at my PhD program at UCLA in the Fall. I'm into psychology and neuroscience research and dependent on Excel, GraphPad, and related platforms.
